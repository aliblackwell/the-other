### The Circuit

#### Lights:

RED POWER -> RESISTOR 1 # Power and protection

RESISTOR 2 -> LED RED # Lights

LED BLACK -> TRANSISTOR COLLECTOR # Into the transistor

TRANSISTOR BASE -> ARD PIN 9 # Regulated voltage from Arduino

TRANSISTOR EMITTER -> BLACK POWER # Complete the circuit

#### Gyro:

ARD 3.3V -> UCC
ARD GND -> GND
ARD A4 -> SDA
ARD -> A5

INT -> ARD PIN 2
