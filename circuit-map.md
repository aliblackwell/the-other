### The Circuit

#### Lights:

RED POWER -> RESISTOR 1 # Power and protection

RESISTOR 2 -> LED RED # Lights

LED BLACK -> TRANSISTOR COLLECTOR # Into the transistor

TRANSISTOR BASE -> ARD PIN 9 # Get some code from Arduino

TRANSISTOR EMITTER -> BLACK POWER # Complete the circuit



#### Gyro:

UCC -> ARD 3.3V # Power
GND -> ARD GND #
SDA -> ARD A4 # Not sure
SCL -> ARD A5 # Hmm

INT -> ARD PIN 2 # Interrupt pin
